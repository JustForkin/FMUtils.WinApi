### A collection of useful P/Invoke wrappers and assist methods I'm using for other projects
(but you can use it for whatever - see _license.txt_)


### State of the Code
- Mostly operational
- Relatively unorganized, but roughly divided by how I happened to end up using it


### Usage
- Call the Win32 methods directly
- Several helper methods in `Helper.cs`
